code for bubble plot and three pie charts analyzing pyber ride share data

Three Trends Based on the Data:
  1. The suburban (gold) data showed more variance relative to the urban and rural dots in the bubble chart.  There were multiple gold bubbles to the far right of the plot, where you would expect to see only urban points.  This could represent a larger, busier section of a suburban area, perhaps just outside of the city limits (think Arlington in relationship to DC).
  2.  The general negative slope trend of the data does make logical sense when you think about the majority of ride sharing experiences one has, depending on location.  Ususally, in an urban environment, there are many options for ride sharing, and the ride is usually a short distance, relative to the other types of location data.  In an rural area, the demand for a large number of drivers isn't there, and the rides cover a longer distance, thus increasing the fare.
  3.  I was surprised at the similarities between the first two pie charts.  I would have thought the outliers in the rural data would have pushed the percent of fare relative to the total a little higher.  Eventhough there were a lot less rides in the rural environment, the distance needed to travel and the high fare price in my mind should have raised its percentage more than shown.
