code for bubble plot and three pie charts analyzing pyber ride share data

Instructions:
The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Your objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type

Three Trends Based on the Data:
  1. The suburban (gold) data showed more variance relative to the urban and rural dots in the bubble chart.  There were multiple gold bubbles to the far right of the plot, where you would expect to see only urban points.  This could represent a larger, busier section of a suburban area, perhaps just outside of the city limits (think Arlington in relationship to DC).
  2.  The general negative slope trend of the data does make logical sense when you think about the majority of ride sharing experiences one has, depending on location.  Ususally, in an urban environment, there are many options for ride sharing, and the ride is usually a short distance, relative to the other types of location data.  In an rural area, the demand for a large number of drivers isn't there, and the rides cover a longer distance, thus increasing the fare.
  3.  I was surprised at the similarities between the first two pie charts.  I would have thought the outliers in the rural data would have pushed the percent of fare relative to the total a little higher.  Eventhough there were a lot less rides in the rural environment, the distance needed to travel and the high fare price in my mind should have raised its percentage more than shown.
